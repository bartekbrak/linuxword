# Linuxword

*what*: Curated database of links explaining any word used in Linux world.

*why*: Despite having spent over 15 years in terminals, I keep getting
frustrated by not being able to easily find descrptions of some common or less
common words. The granularity of "word" is important, there are places to check
for binaries, protocols, filesystems. Often, the earlier into the forest, the
more, you just don't know what kind of a "thing" you are looking for.

*scope*: by no means complete, hopefully still useful as contributions will be
added in order of occurence, so the more frustrating stuff, the earlier in the
database

*how*: I will try to share this list with as many people as possible and count
on contributions. I guess I can lure the people I help or mentor to contribut by
guilt ;) but I'm also hoping, one day, this list will become useful.

*trivia*: I can't remember how many times I googled the effect of `LANGUAGE` on
the system, perusing places like `man 7 locale` or endless useless Linux
websites describing something similar. And yes, even Arch wiki didn't give the
answer. Although, Arch wiki must have it, it has everything.

*problems*: websites die, should I copy-paste or is linking enough?
